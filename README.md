# Jvd - just a virtualDOM ðŸ› 

Jvd is a virtualDOM written in Javascript to bind, mount, and manage your DOM like you want. The goal is to create a root based DOM what goal would be store the data to bind in the DOM in the root inside an observed object which would optimize the re-rendre of childs when updated. Roots would be useables in other threes and a hole system of props would be created.
