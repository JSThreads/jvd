/**
 * Jvd - Just a virtual DOM
 * 
 * The goal of the project is to create a easy in use, accessible,
 * fast and optimized virtual DOM. 
 * 
 * - Each root has values used inside that are observed
 * - At each update if the child is updatable is rebuild
 *   from virtual DOM and changed in the page DOM
 * - Props can be passed to child root, as a definition,
 *   like in the case of passing js variables to those
 *   inside the DOM
